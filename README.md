> _**Chi-Squared Test**_
>> Test to (dis)prove the Null Hypothesis, determining how probable it is that two events occur simultaneously by chance alone.
>> To disprove the Null Hypothesis means to conclude that the distribution of two simultaneous events is not explicable by pure chance, but are conditioned.

## Artificial Intelligence
>
> * **Machine Learning:** techniques to make a program learn from data without explicit instructions.
> * **Agent:** entity that percives and acts upon its enviroment.
> * **State:** A particular configuration of the Agent in its enviroment.
> * **Initial State:** the State from where the Agent begins.
> * **Goal State:** desired final State.
>
> _**Markov Model**_
>> * **Markov Assumption:** the current state depends only on a finite fixed number of previous states.
>> * **Markov Chain:** sequence of random variables where their distributions follow the Markov Assumption.
>> * **Transition Model:** Markov Chain that gives a probability of the next state based on the current state.
>> * **Hidden Markov Model:** Markov Model for a system with presupposed hidden states generated by an observed event.
>> * **Markov Decission Process:** Markov Model for decisions, states, actions, and rewards.

## Distributional Semantics
>
> Statistical semantic theory of meaning as arising from syntagmatic combinations.
> Thus, words that frequently appear in the same context must have simmilar meanings. 
>
> _**Semantic Space**_
>> In Distributional Semantics, a map of words localized according to their characteristics. Similar words would appear closer than dissimilar ones.
>
> _**Vector Space Model**_
>> Algebraic model of text representation based on creating its own Semantic Space where words are vectors plotted in axis naming semantic characteristics.
>> * Document: dictionary of {terms : weighted_vectors}
>
> _**Bag-of-Words**_
>> Indexing Unit Model that defines terms as an unordered weighted set of lematized words in a text after a stopwords filter.
>>
>> Term =  {bagword : weighted_vector}
>  
> _**Weight**_
>> Multiplier for words based on relevance and entropy.
>>  
>> $t$ : term  
>> $d$ : document  
>> $d_l$ : number of tokens in a document  
>> $N$ : number of corpus documents  
>> $n_t$ : number of documents where term $t$ appears
>>  
>> * **Term Frequency:** relative frequency of a term within a document.
>>    * $TF = \sum \frac{t}{d_l}$
>>  
>> * **Inverse Document Frequency:** meassure of how informative a term is, downweighting frequent terms. Adding $1$ to each operand is a smoothing strategy to counter division by $0$ and edge cases.
>>    * $sIDF = log_2(\frac{N + 1}{n_t + 1})$
>>  
>> * **Probabilistic IDF:** takes into account both presence and abscense in documents.
>>    * $pIDF = log_2(\frac{N - n_t + 1}{n_t + 1})$
>>  
>> * _**Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency:**_ Weighting model based on how informative a term is in a collection of texts. A high weight means high frequency in the document and low frequency in other documents, thus that word would identify said document against the corpus.
>>    * $TF.IDF = TF * IDF$
>


## Frame Semantics
>
> Cognitive semantic theory of meaning as tied to its associated experiential knowledge.
> Thus, any word is necessarily tied to a set of related words that encompass wordly frameworks.
>
> _**Frame**_
>> Information package about how and what to speak in a specific context. \\
>> Set of words evoqued by a given situation.
>
> _**Trigger**_
>> Discursive token that activates a cognitive semantic frame.
>
> _**Situational Frame**_
>> Set of triggers of a frame.
> 
> _**Concept**_
>> Indexing Unit Model that defines terms as an unordered weighted set of the hyperonym of each word.
>>
>> Term = normalization → {coche:sdo},{moto:sdo} → {automovil}
