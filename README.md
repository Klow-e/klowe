# Theory


## Linear Space
>
> Structure consisting of a set of points and the possible relaions between them.
> * **Scalar:** simple quantity expressed as a single number.
> * **Vector:** complex quantity expressed as a 1D array of numbers
> * **Matrix:** complex quantity expressed as a 2D table of numbers
> * **Tensor:** complex quantity expressed as an nD space of numbers
>
> _**Cosine Similarity**_
>> 
>
> _**Euclidean Distance**_
>> 


## Distributional Semantics
>
> Statistical semantic theory of meaning as arising from syntagmatic combinations.
> Thus, words that frequently appear in the same context must have simmilar meanings. 
>
> _**Semantic Space**_
>> In Distributional Semantics, a map of words localized according to their characteristics. Similar words would appear closer than dissimilar ones.
>
> _**Vector Space Model**_
>> Algebraic model of text representation based on creating its own Semantic Space where words are vectors plotted in axis naming semantic characteristics.
>> * Document: dictionary of {terms : weighted_vectors}
>
> _**Bag-of-Words**_
>> Indexing Unit Model that defines terms as an unordered weighted set of lematized words in a text after a stopwords filter.
>>
>> Term =  {bagword : weighted_vector}
>  
> _**Weight**_
>> Multiplier for words based on relevance and entropy.
>>  
>> $t$ : term  
>> $d$ : document  
>> $d_l$ : number of tokens in a document  
>> $N$ : number of corpus documents  
>> $n_t$ : number of documents where term $t$ appears
>>  
>> * **Term Frequency:** relative frequency of a term within a document.
>>    * $TF = Σt / d_l$
>>  
>> * **Inverse Document Frequency:** meassure of how informative a term is, downweighting frequent terms. Adding $1$ to each numerator and denominator is a smoothing strategy to counter division by $0$ and edge cases.
>>    * $IDF = log_2( N + 1 / n_t + 1 )$
>>  
>> * **Probabilistic IDF:** takes into account both presence and abscense in documents.
>>    * $pIDF = log_2( N-n_t + 1 / n_t + 1 )$
>>  
>> * _**Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency:**_ Weighting model based on how informative a term is in a collection of texts.
>>    * $TF.IDF = TF * IDF$
>>  


## Frame Semantics
>
> Cognitive semantic theory of meaning as tied to its associated experiential knowledge.
> Thus, any word is necessarily tied to a set of related words that encompass wordly frameworks.
>
> _**Frame**_
>> Information package about how and what to speak in a specific context. \\
>> Set of words evoqued by a given situation.
>
> _**Trigger**_
>> Discursive token that activates a cognitive semantic frame.
>
> _**Situational Frame**_
>> Set of triggers of a frame.
> 
> _**Concept**_
>> Indexing Unit Model that defines terms as an unordered weighted set of the hyperonym of each word.
>>
>> Term = normalization → {coche:sdo},{moto:sdo} → {automovil}
