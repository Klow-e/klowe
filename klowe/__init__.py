# Clean Code Principles
# # The code should explain itself
# # The code should be beautiful and regular
# # The code should be simple and easy
# # The code should be explicit and flat
# # The code should be defensive and errors be managed
# # A function should only do one thing only
# # One thing is when no other meaningful function can be extracted
# # If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea


# ToDo:
# # setlang exclude chars
# # capitalize textprocessor functions
# # comment with ''' ''' function descriptions
# # add chi^2 to theory
# # create hebrew & greek parser

# create bootcat clone
# # Tuple generator
# # lang detection with stopwords and html
# #
